# A Platformer
A platformer by Tygo aka "Methane Oceans"

## Levels
Levels are loaded from xml files generated by Tiled and the tileset used is the image file defined by the level. Layers have a custom property called "enableCollisions" to decide wether the tiles in that layer need colliders.

## Backlog
- [ ] Fix: Player gets stuck after touching a wall and was still moving to sides. Jumping again fixes this behavior.
- [ ] Rework: Player controller is chaotic evil.
- [ ] Add grappling hook
- [ ] Decide what more is needed

## Changelog
- Added levelmanager class for loading levels from files other than "level0.xml"
- Fixed walljumping
- Fixed "ceilingjumping"
- Changed this amazing readme.md file
- Motivation acquired :D

## Some ideas
- Since you can check for collisions in a list of gameobjects you can exclude some objects to "phase through"
