# A Platformer
A platformer by Tygo aka "Methane Oceans"

## Levels
Right now the game only loads the level0.xml file in the "TiledFiles" folder.
This xml file is generated using Tiled and the tileset used is the image file included in the same folder. This file contains tiles of 16*16 so if you want to change the look of the game you can supply a file that has the same tilesize and you can make your own map with it in tiled.

## Backlog
- [ ] Refine movement and ways player is slowed by collision
- [ ] Add grappling hook
- [ ] Decide what more is needed

## Changelog
- Added a player character (The cardboard box)
- Added player movement and collision
- "Added" walljumping
- Changed the test level layout
- Changed this amazing readme.md file
- MORE motivation acquired :D

## Some ideas
- Since you can check for collisions in a list of gameobjects you can exclude some objects to "phase through"
