# A Platformer
A platformer by Tygo aka "Methane Oceans"

## Levels
Levels are loaded from xml files generated by Tiled and the tileset used is the image file defined by the level. Layers have a custom property called "enableCollisions" to decide wether the tiles in that layer need colliders.

## To-Do
- [ ] Add grappling hook
- [ ] Add a camera that follows the player smoothly
- [ ] Add death >:)
- [x] Decide what more is needed (see scope creep)
- [ ] Do not scope creep pls
- [ ] Update game dev document
- [ ] Do at least 5 1:1 playtests
- [ ] DEADLINE: Week 2.9 (When tf is that? idk, Saxion things)

## Changelog
